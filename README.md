# Predicting-Longer-Term-Volatility
Working Paper

# Abstract:

  Gasoline retail markets have traditionally attracted a lot of attention from researchers and policy makers. This entry reviews 2 sets of questions studied by economists related to this market who seek to understand the behavior of their prices. The first is concerned with whether volatility can be predicted at longer horizons. To investigate volatilityâ€™s predictability, a comparative study within the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) class of models is presented. For the period studied (2016-2022), it is found model rankings are insensitive to the forecast horizon with asymmetric volatility models providing the best forecasts.
  
  The second focuses on whether the cyclical spike in gasoline prices can be predicted. In particular, it is widely documented gasoline prices generally start to rise in the spring, just before the start of the summer driving season, with a price spike often at the beginning rise. The goal here is to assess the value of a popular Extreme Value approach in predicting these extreme price spikes.
